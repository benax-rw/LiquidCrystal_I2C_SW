**LiquidCrystal_I2C_SW**

LiquidCrystal_I2C_SW is an Arduino library that allows you to control I2C-based LCD displays using the SoftwareWire library. This enables software-based I2C communication, freeing up the hardware I2C pins for other uses.

**Features**
Control I2C LCD displays using software I2C (customizable SDA/SCL pins).
Supports common LCD commands, including printing text, clearing the display, setting the cursor position, and more.
Compatible with 16x2 and 20x4 I2C LCD displays.
Works alongside hardware I2C devices.

**Requirements**
Arduino IDE: Version 1.8 or higher.
SoftwareWire Library: Install from GitHub.

**Installation**
1. Clone or download this repository to your computer.
2. Copy the LiquidCrystal_I2C_SW folder into your Arduino libraries folder.
3. Restart the Arduino IDE to recognize the library.

Alternatively, you can use the Arduino Library Manager after the library is added to the official registry.

**Quick Start**

**Wiring**

Connect your LCD display to custom pins using SoftwareWire. For example:
SDA: A0
SCL: A1

Make sure to connect pull-up resistors (4.7kΩ or 10kΩ) between SDA/SCL and VCC.

**Example Code**
_
#include <LiquidCrystal_I2C_SW.h>
#include <SoftwareWire.h>

// Initialize SoftwareWire on custom SDA and SCL pins
SoftwareWire myWire(A0, A1);

// Initialize the LCD using the LiquidCrystal_I2C_SW library
LiquidCrystal_I2C_SW lcd(0x27, 16, 2, myWire);

void setup() {
    myWire.begin();           // Start the software I2C bus
    lcd.begin(16, 2);         // Initialize the LCD
    lcd.backlight();          // Turn on the backlight
    lcd.setCursor(0, 0);      // Position the cursor
    lcd.print("Hello, World!"); // Print a message
}

void loop() {
    // Your code here
}_
